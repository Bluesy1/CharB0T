## Docs

You can find the documentation for the bot [here](https://bluesy1.github.io/CharB0T/docs/) and the changelog is [here](https://bluesy1.github.io/CharB0T/changes).

## Contributing

- If you have a good idea for a new feature, create a [Feature Request](https://github.com/Bluesy1/CharB0T/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.yml).
- If you encounter a bug, create a [Bug Report](https://github.com/Bluesy1/CharB0T/issues/new?assignees=&labels=unconfirmed+bug&template=bug_report.yml).


1. Check for an open issue that hasn't been resolved yet.
2. If there is an open issue, check if it is a bug or a feature request.
3. If it is a bug that has been confirmed, if it hasn't been assigned, assign it to yourself, fork the repository,
  fix the bug, and submit a pull request.
4. If it is an unconfirmed bug, see if you can reproduce it consistently, and report that. If you can't reproduce it,
  also report it. If you can reproduce it, see if you can fix it, and create a PR through a fork.
5. If it is a feature request, if it has been approved by Bluesy and you can implement it, create a PR through a fork.
6. If you implement or change something documented, update the documentation and changelogs and submit a pull request for that too.
7. Again, **Be sure to update the changelogs and documentation.** If you don't, I will have to write them myself and your PR will be delayed. -
