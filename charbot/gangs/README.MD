# Note: This is a very special extension to the bot.
Unlike most other extensions, this one is for a specific event on the server this bot is built for.
The things it contains especially do not reflect the creators views, and for the most part, are based off
of a game developed by Double Eleven and Introversion Software, and then published by
Paradox Interactive, called [Prison Architect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/).
The game is a prison management sim, and the gangs are a part of that game.

**_I personally do not condone the actions of the gangs in the game,
and I do not condone the actions of the gangs in real life._**
